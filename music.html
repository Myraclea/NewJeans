                <span class="color">NewJeans' music spans genres</span> such as R&B, electropop, and hip hop.It is characterized by mellow beats, atmospheric synthesizers, and live vocals. Their debut EP and first single album OMG are predominantly midtempo pop and R&B that evoke music of the 1990s and 2000s decades. There were comparisons to the sound of late-1990s K-pop girl groups.Music critics also identified elements of mid-2000s electronic and dance styles such as UK garage,Baltimore club, Jersey club, and moombahton. With their second EP Get Up, they ventured more into dance and club music with a more rhythmic production expanding on the group's UK garage-influenced past releases. Some critics, such as Sheldon Pearce and Minsoo Joshua Kim writing for NPR, described NewJeans' music as soft, contained, and delicate, which is a stark contrast to their contemporaries' "maximalist" and "harsh, buzzing" sounds

It’s common in society to want things now. We live in the present, consumed by current events, with no idea why the present is what it is, or, what comes next. This live-for-today practice leads to quick decision making to achieve immediate change. It seems mankind wears blinders, unable to take in all that goes on around us and why. But not God – He sees it all.

            Prior to debuting with NewJeans, several group members were involved in television, music and dance. When Australian-born Danielle Marsh lived in South Korea, she was a regular cast member of tvN's Rainbow Kindergarten, a variety show that aired until 2011. She also appeared in the TV shows Jesse's Play Kitchen and My Heart's Crayon. Hyein debuted as a member of the children's music group U.SSO Girl in November 2017 under the stage name U.Jeong, before departing from the group one year later. In December 2020, she joined the music group and YouTube collective Play With Me Club formed by PocketTV, and graduated from the group on May 3, 2021.Vietnamese-Australian Hanni Pham began performing in Melbourne as a member of the Aemina Dance Crew who covered the choreography of K-pop groups. Hanni and Minji made a guest appearance in BTS's 2021 music video for "Permission to Dance". </p>

      <p align="justify"> Preparations for a new girl group in collaboration between Big Hit Entertainment[note 1] and Source Music began as early as 2019 under the direction of Min Hee-jin, who joined the company as CBO that same year and is widely recognized for her art direction as visual director at SM Entertainment. Global auditions took place between September and October 2019, and casting into the group commenced from the beginning of 2020.In late 2021, it was announced that the project moved to Hybe's newly established independent label ADOR, after Min was appointed the label's CEO. A second round of global auditions were held between December 2021 and January 2022, and the group's line-up was finalized in March 2022. Dubbed "Min Hee-jin's Girl Group" by several media outlets,the group was originally scheduled to launch in 2021 but was later postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

    <h2>SideBar</h2>
    <p> The group's name, NewJeans, is a double entendre. It alludes to the idea that jeans are a timeless fashion item and the group's intention to carve a timeless image for themselves. The name is also a word play on the phrase "new genes", referring to the group ushering a new generation of pop music.</p>
